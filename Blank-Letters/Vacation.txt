 A vacation is when you take a trip to some Lib_adj place with your Lib_adj family. Usually you go to some place that is near a/an Lib_noun or up on a/an Lib_noun. 

 A good vacation place is one where you can ride Lib_nouns or play Lib_game or go hunting for Lib_nouns. I like to spend my time Lib_verbing or Lib_verbing.

 When parents go on a vacation, they spend their time eating three Lib_nouns a day, and fathers play golf, and mothers sit around Lib_verbing. Last summer, my little brother fell in a/an Lib_noun and got poison Lib_plant all over his Lib_body.

 My family is going to go to (the) Lib_place, and I will practice Lib_verbing. Parents need vacations more than kids because parents are always very Lib_adj and because they have to work Lib_number hours every day all year making enough Lib_nouns to pay for the vacation
