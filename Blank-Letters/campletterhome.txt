Dear Lib_person,
The Lib_place is great.  My favorite Lib_job is named Lib_person.  We have Lib_number people in our cabin.  As you can imagine, it is quite cozy.  

The Lib_noun tastes good.  I like breakfast the best, because we have to wrestle Lib_animals for lunch and dinner.  

The other night we Lib_verbpast, a Lib_noun.
